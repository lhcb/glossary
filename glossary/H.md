## HCAL: Hadronic Calorimeter {#HCAL}

The purpose of the HCAL is to stop and measure the energy of hadrons and prevent them from travelling further through the detector.
Like the «ECAL», it is a sampling calorimeter made of layers of iron and plastic scintillator.

## HLT: High Level Trigger {#HLT}

Software trigger. Software that decides if data from the detectore gets written to storage or thrown away.

## HPD: Hybrid Photon Detectors {#HPD}

A vacuum photodetector consisting of a vacuum photon tube and a pixel silicon detector.
HPDs were used in the original LHCb design (Runs 1 and 2).
The radius of the HPD was 72 mm with 8192 pixels, that were combined into 1024 super-pixels, each 8 pixels size.

## HS06
HEP-wide benchmark for measuring CPU performance based on the [SPEC2006 benchmark](https://www.spec.org).

## HSF: HEP Software Foundation {#HSF}
The [HSF](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates coordination and common efforts in HEP software and computing internationally.

## HTCondor

Formerly Condor. Backend for [CERN's batch service](http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/services/batch). Use `Condor` backend in Ganga.
