## MUON: Muon detectors {#MUON}

Originally five stations (M1-M5) that identify and track muons.
M1 was between [RICH](r.md#RICH)2 and the [CALO](c.md#CALO) but was removed after Run 2.
The rest are at the very end of the detector.
With the exception of the inner-most region of M1, which used triple gas electron multipliers (GEMs), the MUON consists of multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPCs).
