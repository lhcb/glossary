# M

## Minimum-bias data

Data collected with very loose selection requirements.
The NoBias stream uses only a clock-based trigger.
Each Stripping typically uses several other MinBias or MicroBias streams.
These streams typically require
  at least one proton-proton collision,
  event activity above some noise-like threshold,
or similar.

## Moore

The LHCb trigger emulation application. [Project website](http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/moore/) .

## mu

The average number of visible, i.e. inelastic, proton-proton collisions in an LHC bunch crossing.

## MUON: Muon detectors {#MUON}

Originally five stations (M1-M5) that identify and track muons.
M1 was between [RICH](r.md#RICH)2 and the [CALO](c.md#CALO) but was removed after Run 2.
The rest are at the very end of the detector.
With the exception of the inner-most region of M1, which used triple gas electron multipliers (GEMs), the MUON consists of multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPCs).
