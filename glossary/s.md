## Sandbox

A small collection of files passed along with your job. The sandboxes are stored on the DIRAC server and removed after a limited time. The files they contain must be small.

## Scientific Linux CERN (SLC) {#SLC}

Former "default" Linux operating system at CERN (SLC6 default operating system on lxplus until end of 2018)

## SciFi: Scintillating Fibre Tracker {#SciFi}

Large area detector of the Upgraded LHCb experiment, located between the magnet and the downstream PID detectors.

## SE: Storage Element {#SE}

A service at a grid site that stores data. For example: `CERN-USER`, `GRIDKA_MC-DST`.

## Site (Grid)

A computing centre hosting grid computing services. For example: `IN2P3-LAPP`.

## SPD: Scintillating Pad Detector {#SPD}

The SPD consists of scintillating pads and is placed before the [PS](glossary/p.html#PS).
The joint purpose of the SPD and PS is to reduce the background for the [L0](glossary/l.html#L0) electron trigger.
The SPD, in conjunction with the [ECAL](glossary/e.html#ECAL), helps distinguish between electrons and neutral particles like photons and neutral pions.

## Starterkit

One week introduction course into computer usage at LHCb for young students. With no prerequisites on Linux usage, teaching basic survival skills including Grid usage and ntuple production.
