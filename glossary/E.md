## EB: Editorial Board {#EB}

Group responsible for ensuring that all LHCb publications are consistent with the standards and style of the collaboration.

## ECAL: Electromagnetic Calorimeter {#ECAL}

The purpose of the ECAL is to measure the energy of electrons/photons and prevent them from travelling further through the detector.
Like the [HCAL](h.md#HCAL), it is a sampling calorimeter made of layers of iron and plastic scintillator.

## ECGD: Early Career, Gender and Diversity {#ECGD}

The Early Career, Gender and Diversity office has been set up to help LHCb achieve a healthy working environment
with no discrimination on grounds of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, creed, cultural background, etc.
See the [ECGD office webpages](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/ECGD_Office/ECGD-intro.html) for more information.

## ECS: Experiment Control System {#ECS}

The Experiment Control System is in charge of the configuration, control and monitoring of all the components of the online system.
This includes all devices in the areas of data acquisition, detector control (e.g. slow controls), trigger, timing,
and the interaction with the outside world.
Details in the Online System [webpages](http://lhcb-online.web.cern.ch/lhcb-online/ecs/default.htm).

## EDR: Engineering Design Review {#EDR}

A milestone during the construction of a subdetector.
The EDR is a meeting with accompanying documentation that describes the detailed design of a component system of the detector
(e.g. sensors, an [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit), high voltage system)
based on drawings and prototypes that have been produced.
Reviewers with relevant expertise from other subdetectors in LHCb and from other experiments
are usually appointed to conduct the review and make recommendations. The next major milestone is the [PRR](p.md#PRR).

## EoI: Expression of Interest {#EoI}

Please see the entry for [LoI](l.md#LoI).

## Erasmus

High-level physics analysis software repository, similar to [Urania](u.md#Urania) but based on [Bender](b.md#Bender)/[DaVinci](d.md#DaVinci).

## eta

See [pseudorapidity](p.md#pseudorapidity).

## EvtGen

Software package for simulating the decays of heavy flavour particles using a wide range of decay models.
