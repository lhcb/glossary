## CALO: Calorimeters {#CALO}

The entire calorimetry system at LHCb ([SPD](s.md#SPD)/[PS](p.md#PS), [ECAL](e.md#ECAL), [HCAL](h.md#HCAL) is often collectively referred to as CALO.
Its purpose is to discriminate between electrons, photons and hadrons as well as provide measurements of their energy and position.
In Runs 1 and 2, the CALO played an important role providing transverse energy measurements to the [L0](l.md#L0) trigger.

## CB: Collaboration Board {#CB}

The ultimate authority within LHCb representing all institutes within the collaboration.

## CC7: CentOS CERN 7 {#CC7}

"Default" Linux operating system at CERN (CentOS7 default operating system on lxplus since start of 2019).

## CE: Computing Element {#CE}

A service at a grid site that runs jobs. For example `LCG.CERN.cern`, `LCG.RAL.uk`.

## CVMFS: CERN Virtual Machine File System {#CVMFS}

[CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem) is a network file system based on HTTP and optimised to deliver experiment software
in a fast, scalable, and reliable way through sophisticated caching strategies.
