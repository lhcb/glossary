## UFO: Unidentified falling object {#UFO}

Unknown small object (think of a grain of dust) that is falling within the LHC beam pipe into the beam, leading to large interactions between the beam and the object, and thus particle showers.
UFOs are known to cause LHC beam dumps upon detection, as a protective measure.

## Urania

High-level physics analysis software [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Urania), similar to «Castelao», but with the same low-level dependencies as the «Gaudi» project. This project is where crucial and central packages such as those used for «PID» response and track efficiency corrections are to be found (PIDCalib, TrackCalib). Refer to the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Urania) for a list of available packages.

## USPG: Upgrade Software Planning Group {#USPG}

Advisory body to the LHCb management that coordinates the activities for the LHCb software for the Upgrade.

## UT: Upstream Tracker {#UT}
The tracking station located immediately before the magnet in the LHCb Upgrade I, replacing the «TT».
It plays an important role in reconstructing tracks that originate outside the «VELO», such as those that come from K-shorts and Lambda baryons.
The UT consists of 4 layers of silicon strips, assembled in a «x-u-v-x configuration:XUVX».

## UX85

CERN designation name for the LHCb experiment hall underground.
