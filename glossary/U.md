## UFO: Unidentified falling object {#UFO}

Unknown small object (think of a grain of dust) that is falling within the LHC beam pipe into the beam, leading to large interactions between the beam and the object, and thus particle showers.
UFOs are known to cause LHC beam dumps upon detection, as a protective measure.

## Urania

High-level physics analysis software package [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Urania),
similar to «Erasmus:ERASMUS» (now retired), but without «Bender»/«DaVinci» as dependencies.
This project is where crucial and central packages such as those for «PID»
and track calibrations are to be found.
Refer to the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Urania)
for a list of available packages.

## USPG: Upgrade Software Planning Group {#USPG}

## UX85
