## DaVinci {#DaVinci}

Event selection and data analysis application. [Project website](http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/davinci/).

##DecFile {#DecFile}

A file that defines the properties of a specific decay, from which the options file for Gauss is generated. Filename extension: ```.dec```. The decay file for a specific process is named with a "nickname". For example, ```Bd_KpiKpi=TightCut.dec```. The options file for Gauss, generated from the decay file, has a naming convention: ```<EventType>.py``` (see. «EventType»).
For the Standard Model particles the properties are taken from the ```DECAY.DEC`` file, that follows pdg values. 
The list of all decay files available can be found [here](http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/decfiles/). 

## Delphes {#Delphes}

A fully parametric fast simulation technique where not only the detector response, but also the reconstruction is parametrized. See more [here](https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2019/19/epjconf_chep2018_02024.pdf).

## DIRA: Direction angle {#DIRA}

The angle between a line drawn from the «primary vertex:PV» to the decay vertex of the particle and the sum of the 4-momentum of its decay products.
One typically uses the cosine of the direction angle in selections.

## DIRAC: Distributed Infrastructure with Remote Agent Control {#DIRAC}

DIRAC is the software framework for distributed computing used in LHCb.
Official [DIRAC website](http://diracgrid.org/).

## DOCA: Distance Of Closest Approach {#DOCA}

The shortest distance between a pair of tracks.

## DPA: Data Processing & Analysis {#DPA}

«Project:ConstitutionalProject» for the development and maintenance of the offline data analysis workflows and software
for LHCb's Run 3 and beyond.
See also the [DPA webpages](https://lhcb-dpa.web.cern.ch/).

## DSS: Detector Safety System {#DSS}

Protection system for the experiment.
Details in the Online System [webpages](http://lhcb-comp.web.cern.ch/lhcb-comp/DSS/default.htm).
