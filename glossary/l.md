## L0: Level Zero Trigger {#L0}

The hardware-level trigger that operated during Runs 1 and 2.
It synchronised to the 40 MHz bunch crossing rate to limit the detector readout rate to 1 MHz into the [HLT](h.md#HLT).
Information to make the L0 trigger decisions came from the [CALO](c.md#CALO) and [MUON](m.md#MUON) systems.

## LFN: Logical File Name {#LFN}

A path for a file stored on the grid that does not depend on a file's physical location(s).

## LHCb

Our experiment!
See our [private](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/) or [public](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/) websites.

## LHCbDirac

A specific flavour of the DIRAC software for LHCb. It includes some extra functions (for example bookkeeping). See the [docs](https://lhcb-dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## LFN: Logical File Name {#LFN}

Logical File Name. A path for a file stored on the grid that does not depend on a file's physical location(s).

## Luminosity Levelling (lumi levelling)

Procedure of adjust LHC beam parameters such that the instantaneous luminosity stays constant as function of time, although the beam current decreases.
