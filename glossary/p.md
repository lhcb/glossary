## Panoramix

Graphical display of detector and event information. [Project website](http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/panoramix/).

## PFN: Physical File Name {#PFN}

A path for a file on the grid, including the physical location to allow for access.

## PHOTOS

Software package for adding final state radiation (FSR) to simulated particles.

## PID: Particle identification {#PID}

The process of determining what species a final state particle is.
[Charged particle identification](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/LHCbPhysics/ChargedPID) typically separates electrons, kaons, muons, pions and protons.
[Neutral particle identification](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCbPhysics/CalorimeterObjectsToolsGroup) typically separates neutral pions and photons.

## Point 8

Interaction point of the LHC at which the LHCb pit and the cavern are located.

## Power cycle

Short for "turning it off and on again".

## PPG: Physics Planning Group {#PPG}

Advisory body to the LHCb management that defines the strategy and priority of the experiments physics programme.

## Production Request {#PR}

A request for processing centrally a physics request. Production Requests are managed by the LHCb distributed computing team via LHCbDIRAC. LHCb users can create production requests via the [LHCbDIRAC Web Portal](https://lhcb-portal-dirac.cern.ch/DIRAC/?view=tabs&theme=Grey&url_state=1|*LHCbDIRAC.ProductionRequestManager.classes.ProductionRequestManager). Production Requests are subject to approval by the [PPG](p.md#PPG).

## Productions {#Productions}

Centrally managed processing, via LHCbDIRAC, of Production Requests (p.md#PR). Examples of productions include: MC simulation, Reconstruction, Stripping, Working Group productions. A production is a combination of application steps.

## PS: Preshower Detector {#PS}

The PS consists of scintillating pads and is placed after the [SPD](s.md#SPD) and before the [ECAL](e.md#ECAL).
A lead absorber is placed between the SPD and PS.
The joint purpose of the SPD and PS is to reduce the background for the [L0](l.md#L0) electron trigger.
The PS helps distinguish between electrons and charged hadrons.

## PV: Primary Vertex {#PV}

The point of the original, typically proton-proton, collision.

## Pythia

The most commonly used Monte Carlo generator in LHCb.
Typically simulates the proton-proton collision and hadronisation process.
