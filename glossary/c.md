## CALO: Calorimeters {#CALO}

The entire calorimetry system at LHCb ([SPD](glossary/s.html#SPD)/[PS](glossary/p.html#PS), [ECAL](glossary/e.html#ECAL), [HCAL](glossary/h.html#HCAL) is often collectively referred to as CALO.
Its purpose is to discriminate between electrons, photons and hadrons as well as provide measurements of their energy and position.
In Runs 1 and 2, the CALO played an important role providing transverse energy measurements to the [L0](glossary/l.html#L0) trigger.

## CB: Collaboration Board {#CB}

The ultimate authority within LHCb representing all institutes within the collaboration.

## CC7: CentOS CERN 7 {#CC7}

## CE: Computing Element {#CE}

A service at a grid site that runs jobs. For example `LCG.CERN.cern`, `LCG.RAL.uk`.
