## CALO: Calorimeters {#calo}

The entire calorimetry system at LHCb («SPD»/«PS», «ECAL», «HCAL» is often collectively referred to as CALO.
Its purpose is to discriminate between electrons, photons and hadrons as well as provide measurements of their energy and position.
In Runs 1 and 2, the CALO played an important role providing transverse energy measurements to the «L0» trigger.
