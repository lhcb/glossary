## VELO: VErtex LOcator {#VELO}

[Twiki](https://lbtwiki.cern.ch/bin/view/VELO) for the VELO project.

## VeloPix {#Velopix}

The «application specific integrated circuit:ASIC» (ASIC) used in Upgrade 1 Velo, which is based on «Timepix3:Timepix» ASIC technology.
Contrary to Timepix3, the Velopix ASIC does not give information about the deposited charge in the detector. 
It assigns the hits to time bins of 25 ns (synchronous with the bunch crossing period).

## VO: Virtual Organisation {#VO}

Each LHC experiment is a VO by means of which users are centrally managed for example for authorisations in the WLCG infrastructure.
