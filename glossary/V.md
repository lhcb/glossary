## VELO: VErtex LOcator {#VELO}

[Twiki](https://lbtwiki.cern.ch/bin/view/VELO) for the VELO project.

## VeloPix {#Velopix}

The ASIC used in Upgrade 1 Velo, and is based on Timepix3 ASIC technology.
Contrary to Timepix3, the Velopix ASIC does not give information about the deposited charge in the detector. 
It assigns the hits to time bins of 25 ns (syncronous with the bunch crossing period).

## VO: Virtual Organisation {#VO}

Each LHC experiment is a VO by means of which users are centrally managed for example for authorisations in the WLCG infrastructure.
