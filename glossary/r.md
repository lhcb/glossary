# R

## R1: Restaurant 1 {#R1}

Short for restaurant 1 in building 501 at CERN.

## RICH: Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detectors {#RICH}

Gas-filled detectors that employ spherical mirrors to focus Cherenkov light into rings.
The radius of each ring is a function of the velocity of the particle, which, when combined with momentum (from the tracking system), provides discrimination between particles of different mass.
In particular, the LHCb RICH discriminates between charged pions, charged kaons and protons.
LHCb has two RICH detectors: RICH1, located between the [VELO](v.md#VELO) and the [TT](t.md#TT); and RICH2, located after the tracking stations.
