## BCM: Beam Conditions Monitor {#BCM}

A system to detect possible LHC malfunction and protect LHCb against possible damage by constantly monitoring the particle flux.  
The BCM consists of two stations with 8 diamond sensors each symetrically distributed around the beampipe. The BCM-U is located upstream and the BCM-D downstream of the interaction region. For Run 3 and beyond the BCM stations are equipped with new sets of diamond sensors.
See [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2487) for further details (on the Run 1 & 2 version of the BCM).


## Bender

Python-based physics analysis environment. [Project website](http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/bender/).

## Bookkeeping

The LHCb data recording and data provenance tool. Every single file ever produced by LHCb centrally-managed «productions:Productions» is recorded by the LHCb Bookkeeping. Users can browse the contents of the Bookkeeping via the [LHCbDIRAC Web Portal](https://lhcb-portal-dirac.cern.ch/DIRAC/?view=tabs&theme=Grey&url_state=1|*LHCbDIRAC.BookkeepingBrowser.classes.BookkeepingBrowser).

## Boole

The LHCb digitisation (simulation of detector response) application. [Project website](http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/boole/).

## BPV: Best Primary Vertex {#BPV}

Online: a «primary vertex:PV» with respect to which a particle (or a track) has the smallest «impact parameter:IP».
Offline: a primary vertex with respect to which a particle (or a track) has the smallest IP $$\chi^{2}$$.
