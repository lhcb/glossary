## BCM: Beam Conditions Monitor {#BCM}

A system to detect possible LHC malfunction and protect LHCb against possible damage by constantly monitoring the particle flux.  
The BCM consists of two stations with 8 diamond sensors each symetrically distributed around the beampipe. The BCM-U is located upstream and the BCM-D downstream of the interaction region. During the LHCb Upgrade I the BCM stations were equipped with new sets of diamond sensors.
See [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2487) for further details (on the Run 1 & 2 version of the BCM).

Python-based physics analysis environment. [Project website](http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/bender/).

## Bookkeeping

The LHCb data recording and data provenance tool. Every single file ever produced by LHCb centrally-managed «productions:Productions» is recorded by the LHCb Bookkeeping. Users can browse the contents of the Bookkeeping via the [LHCbDIRAC Web Portal](https://lhcb-portal-dirac.cern.ch/DIRAC/?view=tabs&theme=Grey&url_state=1|*LHCbDIRAC.BookkeepingBrowser.classes.BookkeepingBrowser).
