## Fast simulation {#FastSimulation}

A family of Monte Carlo speed-up simulation techniques developed for the LHCb simulations to reduce CPU resources. The fast simulation can be produced with different options:

+ «ReDecay»
+ «TrackerOnly»
+ «RICHless»
<<<<<<< HEAD
+ «Lamarr»
+ SplitSim

## FD: flight distance {#FD}
Distance a particle has travelled from a vertex, reconstructed as the distance between a vertex and the decay vertex of the particle. Usually defined with respect to the associated «primary vertex:PV» or the «vertex of origin:ORIGINVERTEX».

## FDCHI2: flight distance $$\chi^2$$ {#FDCHI2}
$$\chi^2$$ of the «flight distance:FD» of a particle ($$\chi_\text{FD}^2$$) with respect to a vertex. A measure for how well the decay vertex of the particle can be separated from a vertex.

## FEST: Full Experiment System Test {#FEST}

A FEST is designed to be an end-to-end test of the experiment's online and offline processing chains. Simulated data is propagated through the trigger system (online) and then through DIRAC transformations to run offline jobs on the distributed computing system. The aim is to mimick real data-taking conditions as closely as possible in order to discover, diagnose, and fix any issues that may be present.

The first FEST was made in 2008–2009 in preparation for Run 1. A FEST in preparation for Run 3 is [foreseen](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1006607/) sometime in the summer of 2021.

## Flavour Tagging

(In LHCb typically) Determination of the sign of the bottomness of a meson at production. I.e. if it was a B or an anti-B at production.
