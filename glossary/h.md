## HCAL: Hadronic Calorimeter {#HCAL}

The purpose of the HCAL is to stop and measure the energy of hadrons and prevent them from travelling further through the detector.
Like the [ECAL](e.md#ECAL), it is a sampling calorimeter made of layers of iron and plastic scintillator.

## HLT: High Level Trigger {#HLT}

Software trigger. Software that decides if data from the detectore gets written to storage or thrown away.

## HS06

## HSF: HEP Software Foundation {#HSF}
The [HSF](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates coordination and common efforts in HEP software and computing internationally.
