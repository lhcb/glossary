## HCAL: Hadronic Calorimeter {#HCAL}

Like the [ECAL](glossary/e.html#ECAL), it is a sampling calorimeter made of layers of iron and plastic scintillator.

## HLT: High Level Trigger {#HLT}

Software trigger. Software that decides if data from the detectore gets written to storage or thrown away.

## HS06
