## IOV: Interval Of Validity {#IOV}

The period of time for which a specific piece of conditions data is valid.

## IP: Impact Parameter {#IP}
The shortest distance between a track and a vertex. In selections typically used with respect to the associated «primary vertex:PV» or «vertex of origin:ORIGINVERTEX». 

## IPCHI2: Impact Parameter $$\chi^2$$ {#IPCHI2}
$$\chi^2$$ of the «impact parameter:IP»  ($$\chi_\mathrm{IP}^2$$) of a track with respect to a vertex. A measure for how well a track can be separated from a vertex, in other words how likely the track originated from the vertex. 

## IT: Inner Tracker {#IT}

A silicon tracker covering the high-occupancy inner region of the 3 tracking stations located after the magnet.
Much like the «TT», each IT station consists of 4 layers of silicon strips, oriented at 0°, −5°, +5° and 0° from the vertical.
