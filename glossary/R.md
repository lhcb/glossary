# R

## R1: Restaurant 1 {#R1}

Short for restaurant 1 in building 501 at CERN.

## Readout Board {#ReadoutBoard}

A generic component designed for data acquisition of all detectors, distribution of the timing and fast commands and the slow control.
In LHCb the «PCI Express 40 board:PCIe40» (PCIe40) is used, see the [LHCb Trigger and Online TDR](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1701361/files/LHCB-TDR-016.pdf).

## ReDecay {#ReDecay}

A fast simulation technique that is based on re-usage of the fully simulated underlying event and re-decaying the signal process multiple times. Further details in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10362.pdf) and/or [Twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/FAQ/GeneratorFAQ#How_do_I_use_ReDecay_as_descibed).

## RICH: Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detectors {#RICH}

Gas-filled detectors that employ spherical mirrors to focus Cherenkov light into rings.
The radius of each ring is a function of the velocity of the particle, which, when combined with momentum (from the tracking system), provides discrimination between particles of different mass.
In particular, the LHCb RICH discriminates between charged pions, charged kaons and protons.
LHCb has two RICH detectors: RICH1, located between the «VELO» and the «TT»; and RICH2, located after the tracking stations.

## RICH-less {#RICHless}

A fast simulation configuration in which Cherenkov photons are not simulated in the «RICH», but including RICH material. See [Twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/FAQ/GeneratorFAQ#How_do_I_do_RICH_less_Simulation).

## RRB: LHC experiments Resources Review Board {#RRB}

The [CERN committee](https://cern.ch/committees/LHCRRB) responsible for overseeing the finances of the LHC experiments,
both for operational costs and for the construction of the detectors and their major upgrades.
The committee is attended by representatives of all the funding agencies that support the experiments.
The committee meets twice per year and LHCb reports to them in closed sessions.

## RTA: Real-Time Analysis {#RTA}

«Project:ConstitutionalProject» for the development and maintenance of the real-time processing of LHCb's data for Run 3 and beyond.
See also the [RTA twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/LHCb/RealTimeAnalysis).
