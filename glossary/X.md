# X

## X.509

A cryptographic standard which defines how to implement service security using electronic certificates,
based on the use of a private and public key combination. It is widely used on web servers accessed
using the HTTPS protocol, and is the main authentication mechanism on the WLCG infrastructure.

## XRootD

Software framework that is a fully generic suite for fast, low latency and scalable data access.

## x-u-v-x configuration {#xuvx}

A configuration for the orientation of 4 layers in a tracking detector station. Layers are tilted by 0°, −5°, +5° and 0° with respect to the vertical (angles are LHCb-specific) to reduce the number of reconstructed ghost tracks. The configuration was used in the «TT» and «IT»/«OT» during Runs 1 and 2, and will be used in the «UT» and «SciFi» from Run 3 (Upgrade I).
