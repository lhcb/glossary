## Grid Certificate

Certificate required to access grid services. Can be [obtained from CERN](https://ca.cern.ch/ca/). To be useable you must be a member of a VO.

## Grid Proxy

X509 authentication to use the grid. The proxy is generated from your grid certificate with the command `lhcb-proxy-init` and by default is valid for 24 hours. In Ganga you create the proxy with `credential_store.create(DiracProxy())`.
