## YETS: Year-End Technical Stop {#YETS}

Periods around the end of the year when the LHC is not running and experiments have a technical stop.
These more or less extended periods are typically used by the experiments to perform maintenance work on its sub-detectors.
They are also used to repair or upgrade detector sub-systems.
