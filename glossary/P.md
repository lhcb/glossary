## Panoramix

Graphical display of detector and event information. [Project website](http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/panoramix/).

## PFN: Physical File Name {#PFN}

A path for a file on the grid, including the physical location to allow for access.

## PHOTOS

Software package for adding final state radiation (FSR) to simulated particles.

## PID: Particle identification {#PID}

The process of determining what species a final state particle is.
[Charged particle identification](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/LHCbPhysics/ChargedPID) typically separates electrons, kaons, muons, pions and protons.
[Neutral particle identification](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCbPhysics/CalorimeterObjectsToolsGroup) typically separates neutral pions and photons.

## PL: Project Leader {#PL}

Person responsible for leading a sub-structor of LHCb that is formally called a "Project". Typically, projects are subdetectors (VELO, RICH, Silicon Tracker, …) but also Computing, Online, and HLT. Physics analysis working groups and physics performance working groups are formally not considered projects.

## Point 8

Interaction point of the LHC at which the LHCb pit and the cavern are located.

## Power cycle

Short for "turning it off and on again".

## PPG: Physics Planning Group {#PPG}

Advisory body to the LHCb management that defines the strategy and priority of the experiments physics programme.

## Physics (Analysis) Working Group (often short "Working Group (WG)")

See the section below [Physics Planning Group](http://lhcb-conv.web.cern.ch/lhcb-conv/StructureDefault.html#Physics_Planning_Group)

## PPWG: Physics Performance Working Group {#PPWG}

See the section below [Physics Planning Group](http://lhcb-conv.web.cern.ch/lhcb-conv/StructureDefault.html#Physics_Planning_Group)

## Production Request {#PR}

A request for processing centrally a physics request. Production Requests are managed by the LHCb distributed computing team via LHCbDIRAC. LHCb users can create production requests via the [LHCbDIRAC Web Portal](https://lhcb-portal-dirac.cern.ch/DIRAC/?view=tabs&theme=Grey&url_state=1|*LHCbDIRAC.ProductionRequestManager.classes.ProductionRequestManager). Production Requests are subject to approval by the «PPG».

## Productions {#Productions}

Centrally managed processing, via LHCbDIRAC, of «Production Requests:PR». Examples of productions include: MC simulation, Reconstruction, Stripping, Working Group productions. A production is a combination of application steps.

## PRR: Production Readiness Review {#PRR}

A milestone during the construction of a subdetector. The PRR occurs after the «EDR».
The PRR is a meeting with accompanying documentation that describes the detailed design of a component system of the detector
(e.g. sensors, an [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit), high voltage system).
Reviewers with relevant expertise from other subdetectors in LHCb and from other experiments are usually appointed
to conduct the review and make recommendations.
The PRR makes recommendations for revisions or approves that the final production of this element of the subdetector can start.

## Pseudorapidity

The angle between a particle's trajectory and the beam axis, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorapidity).

## PS: Preshower Detector {#PS}

The PS consists of scintillating pads and is placed after the «SPD» and before the «ECAL».
A lead absorber is placed between the SPD and PS.
The joint purpose of the SPD and PS is to reduce the background for the «L0» electron trigger.
The PS helps distinguish between electrons and charged hadrons.

## PV: Primary Vertex {#PV}

The point of the original, typically proton-proton, collision.

## Pythia

The most commonly used Monte Carlo generator in LHCb.
Typically simulates the proton-proton collision and hadronisation process.
